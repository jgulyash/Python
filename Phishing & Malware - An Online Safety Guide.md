## Stay Safe Online: A Quick Guide to Phishing and Malware

### Phishing Emails: Don't Take the Bait!

Phishing emails are sneaky tricks where bad guys pretend to be someone you trust (like your bank or a store) to steal your information.

**Watch Out For:**

* **Urgent requests:** "Act now or your account will be locked!"
* **Fake senders:** Email addresses that look real but are slightly off (amaz0n.com instead of amazon.com).
* **Generic greetings:** "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
* **Weird links:** Hover your mouse over links to see where they \*really\* go.
* **Unexpected attachments:** Don't open files you weren't expecting.
* **Requests for personal info:** No real company asks for passwords via email.
* **Spelling and grammar errors:** While not always, poor writing can be a red flag.
* **Offers that are too good to be true:** Free vacations, prizes, or large sums of money.

**Examples of Phishing Scams:**

* Fake account alerts
* Urgent fund transfers
* Fake login pages
* Delivery issues
* Social media scams
